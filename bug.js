```javascript
//Incorrect usage of $inc operator
db.collection('myCollection').updateOne({"_id":ObjectId("650331e464829716a40595a6")},{$inc:{counter:1}});
//This will increment the counter field by 1. 
//However, if the counter field does not exist, it will create the field and set it's value to 1.
//The unexpected behavior can occur if you expect a default value of 0, when the field does not exist
```
